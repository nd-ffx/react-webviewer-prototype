# This is a fork of WebViewer - React sample
### modified to support audio and video and work with @cyntler/react-doc-viewer

[WebViewer](https://www.pdftron.com/documentation/web/) is a powerful JavaScript-based PDF Library that's part of the [PDFTron PDF SDK](https://www.pdftron.com). It provides a slick out-of-the-box responsive UI that interacts with the core library to view, annotate and manipulate PDFs that can be embedded into any web project.
